This is the Maps library, which is broken into 2 different categories.

1) RPF (Raster Product Format)
    - This library contains classes that can read and draw the CADRG RPF format.  All that is needed is the A.TOC file and associated map data.
    
2) VPF (Vector Product Format) 
    - This library contains the beta version of maps that can read VPF files, although it is regulated to level 0 at this time, and ony works
    under windows.  This is a very beta version, and hopefully in the future will be exanded upon.
    
For more information on how to setup the RPF library in an application (using Eaagles Description Language (.edl)), please see CadrgMap.h
