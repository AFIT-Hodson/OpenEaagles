

OpenEaagles is using just the osg math library (math, vec2, vec3, vec4, matrix and quat)

      1) removed the need for osg::object and osg::notify in math library
      2) changed #include paths
      3) switching between float and double using "LCREAL_DOUBLE"
      4) wrapped in 'Eaagles' namespace
